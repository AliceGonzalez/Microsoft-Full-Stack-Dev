***BOLLEN OPERATORS*** 
(true and false values)

AND:
   -Eveluate 2 expressions
   -Result true if only both expression are true
   -Returns false if one or both expressions are false

OR:
   -Eveluates 2 expressions
   -Results true if one or both expression are true
   -Results false on\y when BOTH expressions are false

NOT:
   -Operates on 1 expression
   -Negates the truth value of the expression

***CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS***
(how to use boolean statements to control flow of a program)

IF:
   -Operates on 1 or more expressions
   -Eveluates true value of the expression
   -Executes code block based on the result of the evaluation
   -Well designed to address expressions that evaluate to a single truth value

SWITCH:
   -Operates on expression that can have a variety of values
   -Esecutes block code when a value (case) is true
   -Includes default option in case none values is true

(for variety of possible values use multiple IF statements or a SWITCH statement)

***LOOPS***
(Perform same tasks on multiple data item. repeat actions in a program either a specific number of times using a for loop, or until a condition is met)

FOR:
(Helpful in cases where the number of values the programmer has to process is known)
   -Executes block code a specific number of times
   -The number can be specified or a part of the variable

   EXAMPLE: Imagine you have to process ten records in a database by removing spaces before and after the first and last name fields. You can bring the data into a for loop as a special variable that can store all ten records. You can then loop through each record in the variable until the loop gets to the last record.

WHILE:
(In cases where the number isn't known)
   -Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. 
   -Can be used with Boolean statements.

   EXAMPLE: Suppose you're processing records in a database and need to remove duplicates. You can use a while loop to check if a record has duplicates and delete them as long as they exist, without needing prior knowledge of how many duplicates there are.

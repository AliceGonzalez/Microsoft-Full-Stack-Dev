***FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT***

Foundations:
-Front-end: part that runs directly on the user's device,  browser, mobile app, or desktop app. It's where the user interacts with the application. This interaction includes everything they experience and click on, the layout, text, images, buttons, and forms. 

-Back-end: part that runs on the server, managing databases, processing requests, and ensuring that everything functions smoothly. Ex. when you submit a form on a website, the back-end processes your input and retrieves the necessary data from the server to display it on the front-end. 

Full-Stack Developer should master:
   -front-end
   -back-end
   -deliver end-to-end solutions
   -optimize performance
   -prioritize security
   -ensure accessibility 
   -embrace responsive design

Best Practices:

**TECHNICAL SKILLS**
Proficiency in front-end and back-end technologies:
   -Front-end: Web building blocks HTML, CSS, JavaScript
   -Back-end: Server side languages C#, Python, Ruby, Node.js

Familiarity with version control systems:
   -Git

Knowledge of database management:
   -Organizing ans storing data in a way that it can be eaily accesed, managed and updated.
   -SQL
   -MongoDB (non SQL)

**DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES**
Writing clean, maintainable code: 
   Clean code refers to code that is easy to read, understand, and modify, while maintainable code is code that can be easily updated or expanded upon by others. Full-stack developers writing clean, maintainable code means following coding standards, writing meaningful comments, and organizing your code logically. Clean code reduces bugs and makes it easier for teams to work together, ensuring long-term success.

Applying security best practices:
   -Security best practices are guidelines that help protect software and data from unauthorized access, breaches, or other threats. As a full-stack developer, this means implementing data encryption, secure authentication, and input validation to protect your applications from threats.

Debugging and optimizing code:
   -Debugging focuses on identifying and fixing errors in code, while optimization enhances code efficiency and performance. This includes reducing load times, improving database queries, and simplifying your code. Efficient code leads to better performance, which is crucial for user experience.

Continuous learning:
   -Developing new skills and knowledge. In the fast-paced tech industry, staying updated with latest tools and trends is essential for career growth. 

Responsabilities:
-front-end development: 
   Involves building and maintaining the user interface of one or more applications. In this role, developers implement the designs and functionalities of a website or application using languages such as hypertext markup language, also known as HTML, to structure the content of a web page. They use cascading style sheets, also known as CSS, to style that content, making it visually appealing. Finally, they use JavaScript to add interactive elements like form validation or dynamic content loading. For example, full-stack developers might create a responsive navigation bar that works well on both mobile devices and desktops. While a seamless user interface is important, it's the back-end systems that provide the foundation for front-end functionality.

-Back-end development:
   focusing on the server side infrastructure that powers the application. In this role, they manage databases, servers, and APIs to ensure that the back-end communicates effectively with the front-end. For example, setting up an API that allows the front-end to get user data from the database to ensure that the back-end operates smoothly. 


-Database management:
   Manage the application's data. This leads to another crucial responsibility, database management, where full-stack developers design and manage the databases that store the application's data. They ensure that data is stored securely and can be retrieved efficiently by the application. For instance, designing a database to store user information securely and retrieving it when needed for user authentication.

-Security:
   Safeguarding the entire system. Security becomes crucial, and full-stack developers take on the responsibility of protecting data and maintaining user trust. In this role, they implement security measures such as encryption, secure authentication, and authorization to safeguard the application. For example, setting up user authentication and encrypting sensitive user data to protect unauthorized access.

-DevOps:
    Bringing the application to life through deployment. Here, full-stack developers can take on DevOps responsibilities where they handle the deployment of applications to production environments. This involves setting up CI/CD pipelines to automate application deployments to a server. For example, using Docker to containerize an application and deploying it to a cloud server. 

-Testing and debugging or repairing issues in the code:
   Ensuring that applications run flawlessly Identifying and fixing issues across both the front-end and the back-end. For instance, debugging an issue where a front-end feature is not displaying correctly due to an error in the back-end logic
